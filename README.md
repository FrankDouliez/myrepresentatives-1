myrepresentatives
=================

This application is a sample used for a talk I gave to the Utah County Android Developers Group on 3/29/13. It's an application that consumes a web service from whoismyrepresentative.com. It is meant to showcase an architectural pattern that leverages the power of the Android ContentProvider component as a useful service abstraction. This pattern is enabled by an eclipse plugin that automatically generates a ContentProvider based on a visual data model built using the Ecplipse Modeling Framework (EMF). The plugin can be found here: https://code.google.com/p/mdsd-android-content-provider/ along with instructions on how to download and install it. Without this plugin, this architectural pattern would be completely unmaintainable; but with it, it is one of the fastest, most flexible ways to build an Android application that consumes and works with data.

I made a presenation to go along with this sample application. You can access it here:
